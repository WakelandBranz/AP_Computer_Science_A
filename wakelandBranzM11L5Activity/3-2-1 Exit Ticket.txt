3 things I learned from these videos:
    1: ArrayList can only store objects.
    2: When you put a primitive into an ArrayList, it turns into its wrapper class.
    3: The methods of the list interface can also be used for ArrayList.
    4: Generics allow different types of values to be stored.
    5: ArrayList.add appends a variable to the end of an array

2 things I already knew:
    1: Array lists are similar to vectors since they are stored on the heap and have a mutable size
    2: Array lists can store multiple types of variables at once

1 question I still have about this subject:
    1: How much slower are arrays vs. ArrayLists?
